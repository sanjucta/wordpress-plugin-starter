# wordpress-plugin-starter
A starter template for a wordpress plugin

This is a starter template that I use to quickly create a skeletal structure for a new wordpress plugin.

This is what I do to get started :-

* I rename the plugin folder to my plugin name. 
* I rename the file starter-plugin.php to match my plugin name.(So if I renamed the plugin folder to xyz-plugin then I would rename this file to xyz-plugin.php
* I do a search for the word 'starter' inside the file starter-plugin.php and replace it with my new plugin name.
* I rename the files in the css and js folders to match  my plugin name.
